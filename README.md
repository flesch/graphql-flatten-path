# graphql-flatten-path

The `info` argument of a GraphQL resolver [can often be mysterious](https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-server-basics-demystifying-the-info-argument-in-graphql-resolvers-6f26249f613a/), but it doesn't have to be! `graphql-flatten-path` will "flatten" that path taken through each resolver, resulting in a one dimensional array of `fieldNames`.

## Install

To get started, add `graphql-flatten-path` to your project:

<div>
  <pre>$ npm install --save <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-flatten-path">graphql-flatten-path</a></pre>
</div>

## Usage

`graphql-flatten-path` is helpful when you're re-using resolvers or extending and stitching parts of a schema together, and need to know how the current field is nested under its ancestors.

It can be cumbersome to traverse a field's ancestors using `info.path`, which looks something like this:

```js
{
  "prev": {
    "prev": {
      "prev": {
        "key": "merchant"
      },
      "key": "transactions"
    },
    "key": 1
  },
  "key": "amount"
}
```

Instead, include `graphql-flatten-path` in your resolver to flatten `info.path` to an array of field names.

```diff
  import { graphql } from 'graphql';
+ import flatten from 'graphql-flatten-path';

  const resolvers = {
    Query: {
      merchant: async (parent, args, context, info) => {
+       const path = flatten(info.path, info.operation);
+       // path => ['query', 'merchant']
        return context.db.getMerchants();
      },
      transactions: async (parent, args, context, info) => {
+       const path = flatten(info.path);
+       // path => ['transactions', index]
        return context.db.transactions;
      },
    },
    Transaction: {
      amount: async (parent, args, context, info) => {
+       const path = flatten(info.path, info.operation);
+       // path => ['query', 'merchant', 'transactions', 1, 'amount']
+       //      or ['query', 'transactions', index, 'amount']
        return formatCurrency(parent.amount);
      },
    },
  };
```

For a more advanced use case, take a look at the [included example project](https://github.com/flesch/graphql-flatten-path/blob/master/example) that uses `graphql-flatten-path` inside a "[middleware](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-middleware/)" function to log the execution time of each resolver (and show a warning if a resolver took too long).

```
WARNING: query.merchant ==> 980ms ‚àô exceeds the threshold by 80ms!
INFO: query.merchant.id ==> 427ms
INFO: query.merchant.name ==> 682ms
INFO: query.merchant.transactions ==> 749ms
INFO: query.merchant.transactions.0.id ==> 412ms
INFO: query.merchant.transactions.1.amount ==> 438ms
INFO: query.merchant.transactions.1.id ==> 453ms
INFO: query.merchant.transactions.0.amount ==> 504ms
WARNING: query.merchant.transactions.1.date ==> 929ms ‚àô exceeds the threshold by 29ms!
```

## Motivation

Not to say this module doesn't have merit, but it could have been as simple as something like this:

```js
import find from 'find-key';
export default function (path) => {
  return find(path, 'key');
};
```

üôÄ So why didn't I use an existing library like [find-key](https://github.com/simon-p-r/find-key)? Because I wanted to write something in Typescript and I like recursion, and I wanted to write something in Typescript and I like recursion.
